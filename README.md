# Rust Ray Tracer

A ray tracer implemented in Rust following [Peter Shirley's
guides](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). This is
just a test project to learn Rust.

## Usage

The binary produces images in PPM format. If you have ImageMagick installed, you
can use `convert` to convert the output to a more convenient format:

```
cargo run | convert ppm:- output.png
```

## Progress
